    <h2>üé® Hobbies & Interests</h2>

    <h3>üé≠ Performance & Expression</h3>
    <p>
      I've spent years exploring stage performance in community theatre,
      portraying characters from John Proctor (<i>The Crucible</i>) to the Beast
      (<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>). I also enjoy character voices, accents (RP
      English, Persian), and amateur classical singing, especially when it
      surprises a dinner guest or helps bring a role to life.
    </p>

    <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Creative Writing</h3>
    <p>
      I'm drawn to poetic and evocative prose. I regularly write fiction,
      screenplays, and experimental short scenes, often practicing with prompts
      that push unconventional imagery and phrasing. I'm especially influenced
      by authors like George R. R. Martin and fascinated by the mechanics of
      story, rhythm, and sound.
    </p>

    <h3>üß† Mental Health & Deep Listening</h3>
    <p>
      I find meaning in emotional support work and learning about
      trauma-informed care. My hotline and QA experience sparked a continuing
      interest in active listening, psychology, and how people process crisis.
      This also informs how I approach communication in writing, dialogue, and
      tech.
    </p>

    <h3>üéÆ Gaming & Interactive Media</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a retro gaming enthusiast with a passion for <i>SNES classics</i>,
      <i>open world RPGs</i>, and <i>swashbuckling fantasy</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>üß™ AI, Logic, and Systems</h3>
    <p>
      I love reverse engineering chatbot behavior, designing test prompts, and
      evaluating how models interpret instruction. I enjoy finding elegant logic
      puzzles in code, process audits, or systems thinking, whether it's for a
      QA framework or a fictional government in a story.
    </p>

    <h3>üì∑ Photography</h3>
    <p>
      Occassionally, I'll use my old Nikon D80 to capture moments I believe are
      difficult to describe with words. It's a hobby I seldom have time for
      these days, but one I find grounding.
    </p>

    <h3>üó≥Ô∏è Civic Curiosity</h3>
    <p>
      I'm interested in policy, voting systems, and political discourse. I've
      canvassed for a local candidate and designed system prompts for a
      fictional AI named Rowan, who models thoughtful civic dialogue. I'm
      fascinated by how information architecture and empathy affect public
      opinion.
